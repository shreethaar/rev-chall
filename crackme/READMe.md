# CrackMe

### What is CrackMe:
- A compiled binary or executables designed to be evaluate reverse engineering skills. The objective is to bypass some form of protection mechanism (like password check, license validation, encryption, etc) to understand how to program works internally

### Objective:
- Find a valid input (like a password, key or flag) that allows the program to execute successfully or unlock certain functionality
- Patch the binary so that it always accepts any inputs as valid (bypassing the check)- Reverse engineer the logic behind the program to understand its inner workings

### Common Tasks:
- Finding hidden passwords or keys within the binary
- Modifying the binary code (patching) to skip checks or alter behavior
- Understanding obfuscated or encrypted algorithms
