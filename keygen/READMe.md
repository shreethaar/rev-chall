# Keygen

### What is Keygen:
- A "keygen" is a tool or script created by the participant that generates valid serial numbers, activation code or keys for a given program. Instead of just find one valid key or bypassing a check, it must be reverse engineer to validate keys and then create a program that can generate an unlimited number of valid keys

### Objective:
- Fully reverse engineer the algorithm that validates keys or serials
- Write a standalone program (the "keygen") that produces valid keys based on the reversed algorithm

### Common Tasks:
- Analyzing the key validation routine in the binary
- Identifying patterns or mathematical formulas used to generate or validate keys
- Writing a new program (in Python,C, or another language) that mimics the key generation process.
